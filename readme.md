# Cute and simple Laravel shopping cart.

Created for demonstration a to show some key things and other that I liked. Some of them are:
</br></br>
- Stripe integration for payments. </br>
- Database Seeders to full database with some dummy data. </br>
- Session usage for the cart. </br>
- Serializing php Objects to save them as text on the database. Unserialize them to retrieve them as objects in PHP code. </br>
- AJAX POST requests to refresh cart product's number without refreshing when adding them.
